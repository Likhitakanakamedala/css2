        <p id="p1">
            Developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995, Java is a highly popular, object-oriented programming language. This platform independent programming language is utilized for Android development, web development, artificial intelligence, cloud applications, and much more.
        </p>
        <h2 class="side">Basics of Java</h2>
        <p class="p2">
            Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years.
Java is Object Oriented. However, it is not considered as pure object-oriented as it provides support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc)
         </p>
         <h2 class="side">Applications of Java</h2>
         <p id="p2">
            When compared with Python, Java kind of fits between C++ and Python. The programs are written in Java typically run faster than corresponding Python programs and slower than C++. Like C++, Java does static type checking, but Python does not.
         </p>
         <h2 class="side">Prerequisites to Learn Java</h2>
         <p class="p3">
            Well, in this article, we have linked all our best resources to teach you the core of the Java programming language in easy and simple way. But before diving into the world of Java programming it is expected that readers are familiar with the fundamentals of any programming language. So that he/she can easily understand variables, instructions, syntax, and other terms.
